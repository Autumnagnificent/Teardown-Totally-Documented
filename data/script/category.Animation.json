  "description": [
    "An animator manages a prefab hierarchy using a matching skeleton and a set of animation sequences. These animations are processed sequentially, generating a \"blend-tree.\"",
    "",
    "There are two types of animations: looping and single-shot. Looping animations must be called every frame to keep them active; otherwise, they will stop. In contrast, single-shot animations are triggered once and will play to completion.",
    "",
    "Single-shot animations are automatically processed after all looping animations, but they can be executed earlier if necessary. To ensure that single-shot animations are processed in the correct order within the blend-tree, an instance API is available.",
    "",
    "Inverse Kinematics (IK) can be used, typically as the final step, to control specific parts of the skeleton, such as reaching for an object."
