    "Teardown uses Lua version 5.1 as scripting language. The Lua 5.1 reference manual can be found [here](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/). ",
    "Each Teardown script runs in its own Lua context and can only interact with the engine and other scripts ",
    "through API functions and the registry. The registry is a database of hierarchical global variables that is used both internally",
    "in the engine, for communication between scripts and as a way to save persistent data.",
    "",
    "The Teardown API uses only native lua types. Handles to objects are plain Lua numbers. Vector types are represented",
    "as plain Lua tables, and so on. Each script has four callback functions.",
