    "billboard particles simulated with gravity and velocity that can be used for fire, debris, rain, snow and such. ",
    "Smoke particles are only intended for smoke and they are simulated with fluid dynamics internally and rendered",
    "with some special tricks to get a more smoke-like appearance.",
    "",
    "All functions in the particle API, except for SpawnParticle modify properties in the particle state, which is",
    "then used when emitting particles, so the idea is to set up a state, and then emit one or several particles ",
    "using that state.",
    "",
    "Most properties in the particle state can be either constant or animated over time. Supply a single argument",
    "for constant, two argument for linear interpolation, and optionally a third argument for other types of ",
    "interpolation. There are also fade in and fade out parameters that fade from and to zero."
