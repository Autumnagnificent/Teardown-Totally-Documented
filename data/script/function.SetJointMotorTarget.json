    "If a joint has a motor target, it will try to maintain its relative movement. This",
    "is very useful for elevators or other animated, jointed mechanisms.",
    "If joint is of type hinge, target is an angle in degrees (-180 to 180) and velocity",
    "is given in radians per second. If joint type is prismatic, target is given",
    "in meters and velocity is given in meters per second. Setting a motor target will",
    "override any previous call to SetJointMotor."
