# Lua Language Server Addon Template
This is a template for an [addon](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Addons) that can be used by the [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server).

## Publishing to Addon Manager
The [addon manager](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/discussions/1965) for VS Code allows users to easily install and manage their addons. The addons are pulled from [LLS-Addons](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons).

To add your addon to the addon manager, please read the [README for LLS-Addons](https://github.com/LuaLS/LLS-Addons#readme).
